            The two biggest project one which is finish, which is implementing the whole linked list 
            using a sentinel. The second project which i'm working in a group, since we have two 
            different website like, cunyfirst is for classes and blackboard is where teacher post their
            class material. We are thinking of intergrating everything into one where it would be 
            easier to find everything. Maybe a lot of people will like going to one website instead
            of two or three different once.
