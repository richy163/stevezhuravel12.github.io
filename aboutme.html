              The two biggest project one which is finish, which is implementing the whole linked list 
                using a sentinel. The second project which i'm working in a group, since we have two 
                different website like, cunyfirst is for classes and blackboard is where teacher post their
                class material. We are thinking of intergrating everything into one where it would be 
                easier to find everything. Maybe a lot of people will like going to one website instead
                of two or three different once.

                    I'm currently working on a full stack project. It call BetterBlackboard
                    I'm currently learning databases and javascript. After the person signs in
                    they will be able to see what classes they taken and see the grades that
                    they got in the class.
