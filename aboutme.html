        The two biggest project one which is finish, which is implementing the whole linked list 
        using a sentinel. The second project which i'm working in a group, since we have two 
        different website like, cunyfirst is for classes and blackboard is where teacher post their
        class material. We are thinking of intergrating everything into one where it would be 
        easier to find everything. Maybe a lot of people will like going to one website instead
        of two or three different once.
